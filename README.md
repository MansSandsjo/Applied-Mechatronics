Small microprocessor, ATMEGA 88 which communicates with PC to control an electric motor.

All hardware is built on a component level. It is a small external microprocessor system which communicates with a running 
program on a PC. The external processor system will be equipped with I/O for a servo motor. 

Controll motor -> create good readings, is programmed on the ATMEGA 88 and the communication program is ran on a local computer.
